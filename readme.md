# Knowledge Frontend Test

Welcome to the Wallbox Knowledge Test for Front-end developers!

## Getting started
This test is here to let you show us your amazing front-end engineering skills.
The task? Build interactions and a layout of a common web-app using modern front-end technologies. At Wallbox we work with a progressive javascript framework called Vue.js
The task will be to implement a charger list and charger detail with a responsive design.


## Minimum Goals
- Create an application with Vue3 using the backend a mockups provided.
- Consider not to use any CSS framework, so we can evaluate your css skills.
- Consider not to use the solutions provided by the JSON server for filtering and paginating the elements, doing this filtering at the frontend lets us evaluate your javascript skills.
- The application will be tested using the same algorithm provided to test the resilience of the platform.
- You have an assets folder, you can use that and any icons you consider.
 

## What will we value most?

- The quality of the layout and user interactions.
- Clean code, best practices, and app structure.
- Tested code (Unit test, E2E)    
- Responsive design.
- Data structures, methods, and algorithms.
- App performance.
- Documented code (Storybook)

## Be pragmatic

Your time is your most valuable asset. We expect you to stick to the requirements and we don't want you to do the same work twice.
Here are some advises you can follow in order to do it faster:

- Not everything need to be tested, nor documented. Take one part of the application where you think we can value you the most.
- You can do the same with the responsive design. We gave you a mobile version just for one thing.
- Don't be afraid to comment the code, "with more time, I would have done it this way: ..."

Remember, we don't want you to do the same thing twice, but that doesn't mean you have to do a sloppy work. We want samples of your skills.

## Frontend
To build the user interface you should use the latest version of the Vue.js framework:

- vue.js (​https://v3.vuejs.org/) 
                             
Configure your default setup and add all the dependencies that you may need.

## Backend
You have a [swagger](https://gitlab.com/wallbox/hiring/frontend/knowledge-frontend-test/-/blob/master/backend/openapi.yaml) with all the information.
Also we provide raw documentation with the same information

```
backend/api_documentation.html
```
## to serve the backend:

Dataset Just a few chargers
```console
npx json-server backend/dataset/db.json
```

Dataset of 1000 chargers 
```console
npx json-server backend/dataset/db_long.json
```

Random generated Dataset
```console
npx json-server backend/dataset/random-db.js
```

## Enums and units

### charger status 

- **10, 11** - ready
- **20** - charging
- **50, 51, 52, 53, 45, 55** - error

### charger types 

- Cooper
- Commander
- Pulsar

### connectivityType

- ethernet
- wifi

### chargingTime
- milliseconds

### currentCharging
- Amps

### energySupplied
- KiloWatts

### manufacturedDate
- ISO Date

## Design
The design is important and it's something that we take very seriously at Wallbox.                
You have a [high-fidelity wireframes with figma](https://www.figma.com/file/LyCKXPruuveHOLXA112jDA/Knowledge-Frontend-Test?node-id=0%3A1) or some captures in the design folder in which you can see the layout of the application. You can use a modern UI widget or component toolkits. Consider not to use any CSS framework, so we can evaluate your CSS skills.
